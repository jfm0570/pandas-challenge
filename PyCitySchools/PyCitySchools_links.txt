Code that I tried but did not use:
# school_students_passing_reading
school_counts = per_school_counts.to_frame(name='student_count').reset_index()
school_counts = school_counts.rename(columns={"index":'school_name'})
per_school_summary = pd.merge(table_data3, school_counts,on='school_name')
per_school_summary
# school_students_passing_reading
# school_counts

# school_counts = per_school_counts.to_frame(name='student_count').reset_index()
# school_budget = per_school_budget.to_frame(name='budget').reset_index()
# school_capita = per_school_capita.to_frame(name='capita').reset_index()
# avg_math_score = per_school_capita.to_frame(name='capita').reset_index()

# data4 = {'school name': school_counts['index'],'Total Students':school_counts['student_count'], 'Total School Budget':school_budget['budget'], 
#          'Per Student Budget':school_capita['capita']}
# data4
# data4 = {'Total Students':[school_counts], 'Total School Budget':[per_school_capita], 
#          'Average Math Score':[per_school_math], 'Average Reading Score':[per_school_reading],
#          '% Passing Math':[school_students_passing_math ], '% Passing Reading':[school_students_passing_reading],
#          'Overall Passing':[overall_passing_rate]}


# per_school_summary = pd.DataFrame(data=data4)
# per_school_summary
# school_counts
